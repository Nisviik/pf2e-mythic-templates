# pf2e-mythic-templates
This module includes the mythic templates from Pathfinder 2e's War of Immortals book in a format that allows you to drag-and-drop onto a creature's sheet and it prompts you with the choices according to the mythic template rules and automatically implements most of those changes.

The module includes a journal entry detailing how to use the template, as seen below:

Pulling the Mythic Template item onto an NPC's sheet will start giving you prompts to add the mythic abilities as detailed in PF2e's War of Immortals. Prompts start with the mythic role you want to apply to the creature, such as Mythic Brute or Mythic Caster:

Afterwards the prompts will follow the table on War of Immortals to start letting you choose which abilities to get at which levels, and these can be limited by the role you chose. For example a Mythic Brute cannot choose Mythic Resilience with Will saves, but they also get Mythic Resistance without needing to choose it, so your choices for a level one Mythic Brute will look like this:

An example of a level 24 Mythic Brute after making all the choices:

Some abilities such as Mythic Skill also require you to make more choices. The choices you made are noted down on those abilities as shown below:

**What is currently automated:**
- Choosing one of the mythic roles and gaining their respective abilities as listed in the mythic template on War of Immortals pg. 168.
- Automates (Mythic) Mythic Defenses with an Ephemeral effect that creates a note on the attack roll whenever the creature gets critically hit.
- Choosing which skills to be used with (Mythic) Mythic Skill is automated. And adds a toggleable +4 bonus to those skills.
- Upgrading skill modifiers to be Extreme modifier for the creature's level because of the following passives are automated: (Mythic) Ambush Excellence, (Mythic) Brutish Athleticism, (Mythic) Mythic Knowledge, and (Mythic) Mythic Mobility. 

**What is not automated:**
- Creatures doesn't gain the mythic trait automatically. (Adding this automatically doesn't create the mythic points section on the statblock)
- Any increase to Spell DC modifiers are not automated.
